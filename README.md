5G Systems with MATLAB®  – A Hands-on Workshop. 

This repo contains the files required to run the hands-on 5G workshop.  The "Work Scripts" files require code additions in order to run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions. Both Work and Solution scripts need data generated from the 5G waveform generator app to be able to run to completion.

The files contain the following exercises:


- Exercise 1 - 5G waveform generator app.

- Exercise 2 - EVM Measurement w/wo impairments.

- Exercise 2 - Bonus - PA input scaling before EVM measurement.

- Exercise 3 - 5G Signal Detection.

- Exercise 3- Bonus - SIB1 recovery.

All the exercises include visualizations.
